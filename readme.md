## orlog?

Orlog is a dice game popular among the Norse and Anglo-Saxons in which the contestants attempt to reduce their opponent's "health", as represented by a set of 15 stones, to zero through various dice rolls and bonus effects.

## webRTC

WebRTC is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via application programming interfaces.
[see here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)

### How i works

Instead of using a signaling server to act as a broker, we exchange messages between the peers, effectively making it serverless, allowing players to connect and play on GitHub docs, this is not intended for commercial use, only as means to understand the API.

### TODO

- [x] Connect 2 peers using webRTC
- [x] make it serverless
- [x] 3D dice roll
- [ ] implement base game logic
- [ ] make it look nice
